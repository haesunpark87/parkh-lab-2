abstract: During redox reactions, oxide-supported catalytic systems undergo structural and chemical changes. Improving subsequent catalytic properties requires an understanding of the atomic-scale structure with chemical state specificity under reaction conditions. For the case of 1/2 monolayer vanadia on Î±-TiO2(110), we use X-ray standing wave (XSW) excited X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to follow the redox induced atomic positional and chemical state changes of this interface. While the resulting XSW 3D composite atomic maps include the Ti and O substrate atoms and V surface atoms, our focus in this report is on the previously unseen surface oxygen species with comparison to density functional theory predictions.
