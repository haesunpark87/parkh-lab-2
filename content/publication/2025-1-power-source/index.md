abstract: Fluoride-based conversion cathodes are promising for next-generation Li ion batteries because of their high voltage and energy densities. High entropy earth abundant fluoride cathodes are attractive for sustainable battery because of the potentially higher cycling stability. While Ni and Co containing equimolar alloys stabilized by high entropy were considered previously, Ni and Co free non-equimolar metal alloy compositions might offer new opportunities to increase materials stability and average voltage. This opportunity was pursued using Bayesian optimization of average voltage for the computational prediction of (Fex1Cux2Znx3Mnx4Mgx5)F2 cathode chemistries. Theoretical voltage, room temperature free energy, and electronic structure of potentially high voltage compositions were computed using density functional theory calculations. The experimental realization of non-equimolar quinary Co and Ni free fluorides with stable rutile single phase and improved conversion reaction voltage by up to 28 % compared to the equimolar alloy demonstrated the power of Bayesian optimization methods for the computationally guided experimental synthesis of fluoride cathodes. Finally, non-equimolar cathode chemistries were found with cycling stability superior to known multi-element fluorides.
